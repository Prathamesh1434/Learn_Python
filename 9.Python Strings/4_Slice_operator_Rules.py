# s[begin : end : step] => step value either +ve , -ve
# Step is +ve => left to right [Forward direction.] => begin to end -1
# Step is -ve => right to left [Backward direction.] => begin to end +1
# Step value cannot be zero.

# Note : in forward direction , end value is zero , then result is empty .
# Note : in backward direction , end value is -1 , then result is empty .
